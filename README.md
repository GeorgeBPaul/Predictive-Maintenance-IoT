# Predictive-Maintenance-IoT
End-to-End Predictive Maintenance System to forecast equipment failures in industrial settings using data from IoT sensors.
## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive end-to-end predictive maintenance system using real-time data from Industrial IoT (IIoT) sensors. The goal is to predict equipment failures in advance, allowing for timely maintenance to prevent unplanned downtime in industrial settings.

The system simulates or uses real sensor data, processes it through an ETL pipeline, trains a predictive model using machine learning techniques, and deploys the model in a cloud environment. Additionally, it features real-time data streaming, interactive visualizations, and automated alert systems.

### Architecture
 Placeholder 

The architecture consists of the following key components:

Data Ingestion Layer: Captures real-time sensor data.
Processing Layer: ETL pipeline cleans, transforms, and stores data.
Modeling Layer: Predictive models trained on historical and real-time data.
Deployment Layer: Models deployed in containers, accessible via APIs.
Visualization & Alerting Layer: Dashboards and real-time alerts.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Docker & Kubernetes
Access to a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, etc.)
Apache Kafka (locally or via a cloud service)

### Installation
### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Predictive-Maintenance-IoT.git
cd Predictive-Maintenance-IoT
### Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Kafka:

Follow the Kafka Quickstart Guide to set up Kafka locally.
Update the configuration files in the config/ directory.
### Set up cloud services:

Configure AWS or GCP services (S3, Lambda, BigQuery, etc.) as needed.
Update the config/cloud_config.yml file with your credentials.
Running the Project
### Start Kafka and run the data ingestion script:
python data_ingestion.py
### Run the ETL pipeline:
python etl_pipeline.py
### Train the predictive model:
python train_model.py
### Deploy the model using Docker and Kubernetes:
docker build -t predictive-maintenance .
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
### Start the API server:
python api_server.py
### Data Sources
This project can use both simulated and real-world data:

Simulated Data: Generated using a Python script that mimics IIoT sensor data.
Real-World Data: NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset and Condition Monitoring of Hydraulic Systems.
### Model Development
The predictive maintenance model is built using LSTM networks, which are well-suited for time-series forecasting.
Detailed notebooks and scripts are available in the notebooks/ and src/models/ directories, showing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
### Deployment
The model is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for scalability.
The API service exposes endpoints for real-time predictions and is deployed on AWS/GCP.
### Visualization and Alerts
Dashboards are built using Tableau/Power BI, displaying real-time data and predictions.
Alerts are configured using AWS SNS to notify maintenance teams when predictive thresholds are breached.
## CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipelines are set up to automate testing and deployment.
Any changes pushed to the repository are automatically deployed to the cloud environment.
